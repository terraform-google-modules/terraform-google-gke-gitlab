# terraform-google-gke-gitlab

This module creates a reslient and fault tolerant GitLab installation using Google
Kubernetes Engine (GKE) as the computing environment and the following services for storing
data:
- CloudSQL for PostgreSQL
- Memorystore for Redis
- Cloud Storage

## Usage
There are examples included in the [examples](./examples/) folder but simple usage is as follows:

```hcl
module "gke-gitlab" {
  source                     = "terraform-google-modules/gke-gitlab/google"
  project_id                 = "<PROJECT ID>"
  certmanager_email          = "test@example.com"
}
```

Then perform the following commands on the root folder:

- `terraform init` to get the plugins
- `terraform plan` to see the infrastructure plan
- `terraform apply` to apply the infrastructure build
- `terraform destroy` to destroy the built infrastructure
